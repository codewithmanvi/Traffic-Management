# Traffic-Management

In the metropolitan cities of India, traffic congestion is a major problem. Traffic congestion is caused when the demand exceeds the available road capacity. This is known as saturation. 
Our approach is to decide the signal time as a function of the number of cars crossing
the signal. If there are a greater number of cars then the signal time will be increased to
clear congestion.
